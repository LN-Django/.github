# Micro Services for Komponenten Basierte Entwicklung (KBE) course at HTW Berlin
This is a micro services project that is implemented with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [DRF (Django Rest Framework)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) with a React front end. The services have a similiar configuration and CI/CD pipeline and therefore we created a [boilerplate / template repository](https://github.com/LN-Django/boilerplate) for further use. All of the services are deployed on Heroku as its own application. The production links are displayed in the corresponding repository.
